## Text editor
There are many text editors out there and it is the most essential tool for any developer. They range from feature-loaded to the most simplistic ones. There can never be the perfect editor for everybody and you have to find your very own favorite. For beginners it's usally better to startoff with a simple, easy-to-use one, that still features all important functions. I would probably advise you to use Sublime Text or Atom first.

Visual Studio Code is a new editor only released a few months back and seems to be awesome. You might want to give it a shot. It also has wonderful support of git, which you will read about in the next paragraph.

## Git client
Git is the de facto standart for developer collaboration. It can be used with a GUI-Application like GitHub for Windows or in it's rawest form from the command line. Either way learning git is an important part of decoming a proficient developer, who is able to work with others.

## Web browser
For us as web developers the browser is a place where we spent a lot of time. Be it fixing bugs or making sure everything looks and works as expected so we should be very picky in our selection of it. Good the developer tools can take you great lenghts. Chrome is the browser most commonly used by web devs around the world. But also the recently released Firefox Developer Edition is worth looking at.


## Elm platform
The Elm platform contains all necissary tools for compiling Elm programs. It does much more than that, but that's the most important fact about it.
